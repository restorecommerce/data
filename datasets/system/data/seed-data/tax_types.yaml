  description: >
    Sales Tax is the style of tax often used in the USA, where many governmental
    entities impose their own tax on every purchase. It's typically added as a line
    item in the subtotal. Sales tax is collected on retail sales at the time of the
    sale to the final consumer, and only the final sale in the supply chain is subject
    to tax.
